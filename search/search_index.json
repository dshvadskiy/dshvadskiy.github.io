That includes popular development tools like Cursor, Windsurf, and Cline. Open source community embraced MCP and started to build MCP servers catalogue.

Venu 3 tracks heart rate, steps, and sleep, activities, and other metrics. Garmin Connect is the platform that syncs data from the watch to the cloud and allows to view it. It also provides an API to access and download your data.  python-garminconnect is a Python wrapper to access Garmin Connect API. </p> <p>Source code for this blog post is available here. To get started, clone the repository and install the required dependencies:</p> <pre><code>git clone https://github.com/dshvadskiy/garmin_mcp.git\ncd garmin_mcp\nuv sync\n</code></pre> <p>After obtaining your Garmin Connect API token, MCP server implementation is straightforward.</p> <pre><code>from mcp.server.fastmcp import FastMCP\n\napi = init_api(email, password)\n\n# Create an MCP server\nmcp = FastMCP(\"Garmin Connect MCP Server\")\n\n@mcp.tool()\ndef fetch_sleep_data(date: str) -&gt; dict:\n    \"\"\"Returns sleep data for a given date\n    Args:\n        date: str - date in format YYYY-MM-DD\n    Returns:\n        dict - sleep data\n    \"\"\"\n    return api.get_sleep_data(date)\n\n@mcp.tool()\ndef fetch_heart_rate_data(date: str) -&gt; dict:\n    \"\"\"Returns heart rate data for a given date\n    Args:\n        date: str - date in format YYYY-MM-DD\n    Returns:\n        dict - heart rate data\n    \"\"\"\n    return api.get_rhr_day(date)\n</code></pre> <p>Test your server using MCP Inspector: <pre><code>mcp dev garmin_mcp_server.py\n</code></pre></p> <p> </p> MCP Inspector <p>Register with Claude Desktop: <pre><code>mcp install garmin_mcp_server.py\n</code></pre></p> <p>After restarting Claude Desktop, your MCP server appears in the Installed MCP servers list:</p> <p> </p> MCP Server in Claude Desktop <p>Now let's ask Claude to analyze my fitness data and recommend appropriate activities based on my personal metrics.</p> <p> </p> MCP Server Authorization <p>Claude Desktop makes several calls to fetch activities, stress, and heart rate data and generates some suggestions.</p> <p> </p> AI-Generated Exercise Recommendations <p>We've successfully linked personal fitness data to an LLM with just a few lines of code.
